# ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Instructions for Project Management

## üìã Project Context
This repository contains a project management system that integrates with GitHub Projects via Model Context Protocol (MCP). The project follows a structured 4-phase development approach with comprehensive tracking and automation.

## üéØ Copilot Automation Guidelines

### Project Structure Understanding
When working with this project, GitHub Copilot should be aware of:

- **Repository**: `namnh240795/project-management-via-mcp`
- **GitHub Project**: Project #6 (https://github.com/users/namnh240795/projects/6)  
- **Development Phases**: 4 structured phases (Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Polish)
- **Issue Management**: All issues are linked to the project board
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs in `/docs` directory

### üîÑ Automated Task Management

#### Issue Creation Guidelines:
```markdown
When creating new issues, always include:
- Clear, descriptive title following pattern: "Phase X: [Feature/Task Name]"
- Comprehensive body with objectives, deliverables, and acceptance criteria  
- Appropriate labels: phase-X, priority level, feature type
- Milestone assignment if applicable
- Link to parent issues for sub-tasks
```

#### Project Board Integration:
```yaml
Status Management:
  - New issues: Automatically assign to "Todo" status
  - Active work: Move to "In Progress" 
  - Completed work: Move to "Done"
  - Link related PRs automatically

Field Updates:
  - Assignees: Auto-assign based on @mentions or context
  - Labels: Apply phase and priority labels consistently  
  - Milestones: Link to appropriate release milestones
  - Parent/Child: Maintain issue hierarchy
```

### üìä View-Specific Instructions

#### Main Kanban Board Usage:
- Primary view for daily workflow management
- Keep "In Progress" column focused (max 3-4 items)
- Move completed items to "Done" immediately
- Use for daily standups and progress tracking

#### Timeline/Roadmap View Usage:  
- Long-term planning and milestone visualization
- Update when phase timelines change
- Use for sprint planning and dependency mapping
- Maintain realistic date estimates

#### Priority Matrix Usage:
- Resource allocation and task prioritization  
- High priority items get immediate attention
- Medium priority items scheduled for future sprints
- Review weekly during planning sessions

### üè∑Ô∏è Label Management Strategy

#### Phase Labels:
- `phase-1`: Foundation setup tasks
- `phase-2`: Core feature development  
- `phase-3`: Advanced features and analytics
- `phase-4`: Polish, testing, and documentation

#### Priority Labels:
- `high-priority`: Critical path, blocks other work
- `medium-priority`: Important but flexible timing
- `low-priority`: Nice-to-have, future consideration

#### Feature Type Labels:
- `core-features`: Essential functionality
- `advanced-features`: Enhanced capabilities
- `documentation`: Docs, guides, README updates
- `testing`: QA, unit tests, integration tests
- `enhancement`: New feature requests
- `bug`: Issue fixes and corrections

### ü§ñ Copilot Automation Workflows

#### 1. Issue Triage Automation:
```yaml
When: New issue created
Actions:
  - Analyze title and body for phase keywords
  - Auto-apply appropriate phase label  
  - Set initial priority based on description
  - Add to project board in "Todo" status
  - Suggest assignee based on expertise area
```

#### 2. PR Integration Automation:
```yaml
When: Pull Request opened
Actions:
  - Link to related issues automatically
  - Move linked issues to "In Progress"  
  - Add appropriate reviewers based on file changes
  - Update project item status
  - Check for documentation requirements
```

#### 3. Completion Automation:
```yaml
When: Issue closed or PR merged
Actions:
  - Move project item to "Done" status
  - Update parent issue progress if applicable
  - Check if milestone completion criteria met
  - Generate completion notifications
  - Update project metrics
```

### üìù Code Generation Guidelines

#### MCP Integration Code:
```typescript
// When generating MCP-related code, follow these patterns:
class MCPProjectManager {
  // Always include proper error handling
  // Use TypeScript for type safety
  // Follow established naming conventions
  // Include comprehensive JSDoc comments
}
```

#### GitHub API Integration:
```typescript  
// Use official GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs
// Implement proper authentication handling
// Add retry logic for rate limiting
// Cache responses appropriately
```

#### Project Management Features:
```typescript
// Focus on user experience and automation
// Minimize manual intervention required
// Provide clear feedback and status updates
// Support both CLI and UI interactions
```

### üìö Documentation Requirements

  - Documentation is updated as needed
  - No security vulnerabilities introduced
  - Performance impact is considered
```

#### Review Assignment:
- Route frontend changes to UI specialists
- Route backend changes to API developers
- Route documentation changes to technical writers
- Route critical changes to senior developers

### üìà Metrics and Reporting

#### Automated Metrics Collection:
```yaml
Track:
  - Issue completion velocity  
  - Phase progression timing
