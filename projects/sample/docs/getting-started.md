# Getting Started with Sample Project

## Prerequisites
- Access to the GitHub repository
- Basic understanding of project management concepts
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions

## Initial Setup

### 1. Repository Access
Ensure you have access to the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namnh240795/project-management-via-mcp.git
cd project-management-via-mcp/projects/sample
```

### 2. Project Structure Overview
```
projects/sample/
├── README.md                 # Main project overview
├── project-config.json      # Project configuration
├── docs/
│   ├── getting-started.md   # This file
│   └── workflow.md          # Workflow documentation
└── tasks/
    ├── backlog.md           # Project backlog
    └── current-sprint.md    # Current sprint tasks
```

### 3. Understanding the Workflow
1. **Backlog Management**: All project ideas and requirements go into the backlog
2. **Sprint Planning**: Tasks are moved from backlog to current sprint
3. **Task Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues for detailed task management
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track progress through the GitHub Project board

## Next Steps
1. Review the project configuration in `project-config.json`
2. Check the current tasks in the `tasks/` directory
3. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow
4. Link this project to a GitHub Project board for visual management
